An open source Library Editor
for Game Maker and LateralGM Libraries.

Written in Java as an alternative to YoYo Games'
Library Maker, this project hopes to address many
of its shortcomings by being cross-platform, developer-
AND community-supported, feedback-driven, and open source.

This project is licensed under the GNU GPL 3+.
Many components can be relicensed to a less
restrictive license (e.g. MIT) PER REQUEST.
The project as a whole, however, is locked into GPL.
